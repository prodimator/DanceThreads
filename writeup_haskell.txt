Challenges faced with haskell was getting the actual concurrent to work, or actually how to even think functionally with concurrency.
We were told to take the mailbox approach of having a list of MVars. I asked a question on piazza on how to deal with the post office implemenation even though lists are immutable in haskell. We also had to decide how to do things between STM and normal haskell concurrency. Everything online points in the direction of STM to stay safe, but after running into too many load issues with STM we decided to stick with basic haskell concurrency. The most laborous part of the haskell implementation was not having any direction / real showing of how haskell handles concurrency. We thoguht the producers/consumers example was too simple to use the code to help us learn how to do this project. We wish we have had received more guidance with the haskell part of the assignment.
